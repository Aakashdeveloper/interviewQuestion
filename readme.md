Problem Solving (Sample Medium Questions)

1.Kth Largest Element in an Array

Question:

       Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

      Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

      Can you solve it without sorting?

Example:1

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
Example:2

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
 

2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Question:

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 

3. Reverse Integer

Question:

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
 

4. Rotate Array

Question:

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 

5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Question:

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
 

6. Maximum Subarray

Question:

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.
 

7. Transpose of a matrix.

Description:

Given a matrix A, return the transpose of A.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the row and column indices of the matrix.

Input:

A list of lists A representing the matrix. The length of A is m and the length of each list inside A is n. (1 ≤ m, n ≤ 1000)
Each element of the matrix is an integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
Output:

Return the transpose of the matrix A.
Example:

Input:
[
 [1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]
]

Output:
[
 [1,4,7],
 [2,5,8],
 [3,6,9]
]
 

8. Search a 2D Matrix

Question:

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

Example  1:

1	3	5	7
10	11	16	20
23	30	34	60
 

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], 
target = 3
Output: true
Example 2:

1	3	5	7
10	11	16	20
23	30	34	60
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], 
target = 13
Output: false

for the following code can you write a program for the client side?


package main


golang in 5 producer producing 5 number one by one and consumer
is responsible for consume number
> it should work in producer 1 producer will produce and consumer will consume
then next producer will produce 1 number and consumer will consume
    and so on
    so all producer 1 by 1 produce number 1

need to build a small part of ios app print out log items
the swift function logdumpGetUnique has a small set of itemstored in a string.
    Each log item is separeted by a semicolon
    your goal is to return a new tring with the following requirnemnt:


1> Remove log items that are duplicate based on username
2> Form each log item remove id= Num propoerty and value.

for item that are duplicate based on the username keep
the first one that appers on the list and remove the subsequent one


example Iput
name = Dan B, username=db, email=db@gmail.com, id=123;
name = hannaa, username=hsmith, email=hsm@gmail.com, id=33;
name = Dan Brick, username=db, email=db@gmail.com, id=663

output
name = Dan B, username=db, email=db@gmail.com;
name = hannaa, username=hsmith, email=hsm@gmail.com;


ios 
need to build a small part of ios app that need to implment a simple 
key-value type of a cache in swift you need to implement a cache class that functions
add,get and size

the add function take 2 param  a key and value and adds the pair to the local cache
when an item is added to the cache this function should return the string "added" and if the item alreday existed
    in the cache theis function should
        return the string "overeritten

        the get function attemp to returive an item from the cache
        based on the key parameter oassed in if the item exist in the cache
        retur the value ,otherwise return string "miss"

        the size function will return numner of item in the cache]



            <script>
               function mul(a,b){
                   return a*b;
               }
               function div(a,b){
                   return a/b;
               }
               document.writeln(mul(5,7).toString());
               document.writeln("<br>");
               document.writeln(typeof mul(5,7).toString());
               document.writeln("<br>");
               document.writeln(div.toString());
               document.writeln("<br>");
               document.writeln(typeof div.toString());
